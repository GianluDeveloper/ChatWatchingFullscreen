# Chatting While Watching Videos Fullscreen

Always wanted to comment in real-time a video with a friend? And doing that with a full-screen beauty?

This project aims to do that. It's configured out of the box to work with Youtube, but is tested also to work with custom uploaded videos (as long as the codec is supported by the browser). Maybe it works even with other streaming services, as long as they provide a frame API.
