# Chat Watching Video Fullscreen

Always wanted to comment in real time a video with a friend? And doing that with a full screen beauty?

This project aims to do that. It's configured out of the box to work with Youtube, but is tested also to work with custom uploaded videos. Maybe it works even with other streaming services, as long as they provide a frame api.
